# Lambda Calculus
Guide to understand the Lambda Calculus

Lambda Calculus is a term usually tossed around in the programming circles supposedly providing the undergirding for functional programming, but I find very rarely understood for what it is in it's original flavour. I undertook this quest to find out what it finally is about and here are my findings.

# Elements of Lambda Calculus
The essential parts of Lambda Calculus can be thought of as three things:

## Variables
## Functions
## Application

# Essential Operations
## Alpha Conversion
## Beta Reduction
## Eta Reduction

# Trivia
While the untyped variant of Lambda Calculus is thought of as a canonical model that can carry out any conceivable computation, not all variants of Lambda Calculus is so. This property of being able to complete any computation is termed as **Turing Completeness** and the typed variant of Lambda Calculus is not Turing Complete.
